## Allele Income

| Source | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| Base Roll | 2d6 |
| 1-3 Markers | +0 |
| 4-6 Markers | +1 |
| 7-9 Markers | +2 |
| 10+ Markers | +3 |
| Per Controlled Tile | +1 |
| Fecundity Traits | varies |
| Genome Size | see below |

### Genome Size Modifier

| Genome Length | Mod |
|---------------|-----|
| < 500 kb | +1 |
| 500-2000 kb | +0 |
| 2000-4000 kb | -1 |
| > 4000 kb | -2 |

*Larger genomes = slower cell division*

## Extinction Resolution

```
1. Have SAFE tag?     → SURVIVE
2. Have DOOMED tag?   → LOSE HALF
3. Neither?           → Roll d6, need 4+
                        (5+ for End-Permian)
```

Lose half = round UP losses, keep minimum 1

---

## Competition Resolution

1. Count markers on tile
2. Count matching tags
3. Winner = Most markers (tags break ties)
4. Displacement = 2+ markers AND 2+ tags advantage

## Biome Tags Required

| Biome | Required | Bonus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Ocean/Sea | [Aquatic] | [Marine] |
| Reef | [Aquatic] | [Reef-Dependent] |
| Coast/Swamp | None | Both work |
| Freshwater | [Aquatic] | [Freshwater] |
| Forest | [Terrestrial] | [Arboreal] |
| Grassland | [Terrestrial] | [Mobile] |
| Desert | [Terrestrial] | [Burrowing] |
| Mountain | [Terrestrial] | [Aerial] |
| Ice | [Cold-Resistant] | [Warm-Blooded] |

## Common SAFE Tags

- [Burrowing] - Almost always safe
- [Small] - Usually safe
- [Freshwater] - Marine extinctions
- [Deep-Sea] - Surface extinctions
- [Aquatic] - K-Pg safe
- [Nocturnal] - K-Pg safe
- [Cold-Resistant] - Ice ages safe

## Common DOOMED Tags

- [Large] - Most extinctions
- [Reef-Dependent] - Reef collapses
- [Marine-Only] - Ice ages
- [Shallow-Marine] - Sea level changes
- [Cold-Vulnerable] - Ice ages
