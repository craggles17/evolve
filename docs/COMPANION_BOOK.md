## 1. Why Era Windows Exist

Every trait in this game has a **minimum era** (when it first evolved) and a **maximum era** (when that lineage went extinct, if applicable). These windows are based on the fossil record.

### The Fossil Record

Paleontologists determine when traits first appeared by finding the oldest fossils showing those features. Dating techniques include:

- **Radiometric dating**: Measuring decay of radioactive isotopes (e.g., Carbon-14, Potassium-Argon)
- **Stratigraphy**: Older rocks are generally below younger rocks
- **Biostratigraphy**: Using index fossils to correlate rock layers globally

### Example: Why Feathers Appear in Era 7 (Jurassic)

The earliest known feathered dinosaurs come from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of China:

- **Archaeopteryx** (~150 MYA) - First bird, Jurassic Germany
- **Sinosauropteryx** (~125 MYA) - First dinosaur found with feathers preserved
- **Microraptor** (~120 MYA) - Four-winged dinosaur

Feathers evolved initially for insulation and display, not flight. Flight came later.

### Example: Why Trilobite Eyes Have Max Era 5

Trilobites were among the first animals with complex eyes, appearing in the Cambrian. However, they went completely extinct at the end of the Permian (Era 5) during the Great Dying. No trilobites survived past 252 MYA.

## 2. The Five Major Extinctions

Mass extinctions are defining moments in Earth's history. The game's extinction events are based on the "Big Five":

### End-Ordovician (Era 1 → 2) - 445 MYA
**Cause:** Rapid glaciation as the supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole
**Victims:** ~85% of marine species
**Survivors:** Deep-water organisms, freshwater species

*Scientific basis for SAFE tags: [Freshwater], [Deep-Sea]*
*Scientific basis for DOOMED tags: [Shallow-Marine], [Reef-Dependent]*

Sea levels dropped 50-100 meters as water locked up in ice sheets, destroying shallow marine habitats.

### Late Devonian (Era 3 → 4) - 372 MYA
**Cause:** Likely ocean anoxia (low oxygen) caused by excess plant growth
**Victims:** ~75% of species, especially reef ecosystems
**Survivors:** Freshwater fish, early tetrapods

*Scientific basis: Reef ecosystems collapsed and didn't fully recover for 100 million years.*

The spread of land plants may have caused massive nutrient runoff into oceans, triggering algal blooms that depleted oxygen.

### End-Permian (Era 5 → 6) - 252 MYA
**Cause:** Siberian Traps volcanism (largest eruption in Earth history)
**Victims:** 96% of marine species, 70% of land species
**Survivors:** Burrowers, freshwater species, small animals

*Scientific basis for roll 5+: This was the deadliest extinction ever. Survival was genuinely harder.*

The eruptions released massive amounts of CO₂ and methane, causing:
- Global warming of 5-10°C
- Ocean acidification
- Ocean anoxia (dead zones)
- Ozone depletion

Recovery took 10 million years.

### End-Triassic (Era 6 → 7) - 201 MYA
**Cause:** Central Atlantic Magmatic Province volcanism (Pangaea breaking apart)
**Victims:** ~80% of species, including most large amphibians
**Survivors:** Early dinosaurs, crocodilians, mammals

*Scientific basis: This extinction cleared the way for dinosaurs to dominate.*

### K-Pg (End-Cretaceous) (Era 8 → 9) - 66 MYA
**Cause:** Chicxulub asteroid impact (10 km diameter)
**Victims:** 76% of species, including all non-avian dinosaurs
**Survivors:** Small animals, burrowers, aquatic species, birds

*Scientific basis for SAFE tags:*
- **[Burrowing]**: Underground animals were protected from the initial blast and cold
- **[Small]**: Required less food during the impact winter
- **[Aquatic]**: Water bodies retained heat and had detritus-based food chains
- **[Nocturnal]**: Already adapted to low-light conditions
- **[Avian]**: Birds survived when other dinosaurs didn't (still debated why)

The impact caused:
- Global wildfires
- Impact winter (dust blocked sunlight for years)
- Collapse of photosynthesis-based food chains

## 3. Trait Prerequisites and Evolution

### Why Hard Prerequisites Exist

Some traits are physically impossible without prior adaptations:

**Flight requires Hollow Bones:**
- Bird bones are pneumatic (filled with air sacs connected to lungs)
- This reduces weight without sacrificing strength
- The equation: Lift must exceed Weight for flight
- Lift = ½ × ρ × v² × A × Cₗ (air density × velocity² × wing area × lift coefficient)
- Reducing weight is crucial

**Tetrapod Limbs require Lungs AND Lobed Fins:**
- Lungs: Can't survive on land without breathing air
- Lobed Fins: Contain bones homologous to arm bones (humerus, radius, ulna)
- Ray-finned fish have fins with no internal bone structure - they can't evolve into legs

### Why Soft Prerequisites Reduce Costs

Soft prerequisites represent traits that make evolution *easier* but aren't strictly required:

**Feathers make Flight cheaper (but aren't required):**
- Birds evolved flight with feathers
- Bats evolved flight WITHOUT feathers (membrane wings)
- Pterosaurs evolved flight with membrane wings
- Having feathers provides: insulation (for high metabolism), aerodynamic surfaces
- But the core requirement is just hollow bones for weight reduction

**Warm-Blooded makes Flight cheaper:**
- Flight requires high sustained energy output
- Endotherms can maintain this; ectotherms struggle
- But insects are ectothermic and fly just fine (different mechanism)

## 4. Population Genetics and Alleles

### What Alleles Really Are

In real genetics, an allele is a variant of a gene. Different alleles produce different traits (e.g., blue eyes vs brown eyes).

In this game, "alleles" represent **genetic variation** - the raw material for evolution.

### The Hardy-Weinberg Principle

The game's allele income formula reflects real population genetics:

```
Base Alleles = 2d6 (random mutation)
+ Population Tier Bonus (more individuals = more variation)
+ Tile Control Bonus (more resources = more reproduction)
+ Fecundity Bonus (more offspring = more chances for mutation)
```

**Larger populations have more genetic variation** because:
- More individuals = more chances for new mutations
- Larger gene pool maintains more allele diversity
- Small populations lose alleles through genetic drift

This is why population tier gives bonus alleles: 7+ creatures = +2 alleles/era

### The Dice Represent Randomness

Rolling 2d6 for base alleles represents the **random nature of mutation**. You might get a great roll (12) or a poor one (2). This is realistic - mutation rates vary, and beneficial mutations are rare.

## 5. Biome Changes and Plate Tectonics

### Why Tiles Flip

The Earth's surface is constantly changing due to:

**Plate Tectonics:**
- Continents drift at ~2-10 cm/year
- Ocean basins open and close
- Mountains rise and erode

**Climate Change:**
- Ice ages expand glaciers and lower sea levels
- Warm periods melt ice and raise sea levels
- Atmospheric composition changes (CO₂, O₂)

**Biological Changes:**
- Forests can only appear after plants colonize land (Era 3+)
- Grasslands are recent (Era 9+) - grasses evolved late
- Coral reefs require specific conditions (warm, shallow, clear water)

### Era Locks on Biomes

**Forests (Era 3+):**
The first forests appeared in the Devonian (~385 MYA). Before this, land had only small plants like mosses and early vascular plants.

**Grasslands (Era 9+):**
Grasses evolved in the Cretaceous but didn't become dominant until the Miocene (~15 MYA). Grassland expansion was driven by:
- Declining CO₂ (grasses use C4 photosynthesis, more efficient at low CO₂)
- Increasing seasonality and aridity

**Ice Sheets (Era 11):**
Major glaciation returned in the Quaternary. The current ice ages began ~2.6 MYA with the formation of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

## 6. Fecundity Strategies

### r-Strategy vs K-Strategy

This is one of the most important concepts in ecology:

**r-Strategy (High Fecundity):**
- Many offspring, little parental care
- High mortality, rapid reproduction
- Thrives in unstable environments
- Examples: Insects, fish, frogs

*Game effect: +2 alleles/era (more offspring = more mutations)*
*Trade-off: Vulnerable to environmental changes*

**K-Strategy (Low Fecundity):**
- Few offspring, high parental investment
- Low mortality, slow reproduction
- Thrives in stable environments
- Examples: Elephants, whales, humans

*Game effect: -1 alleles/era but protected offspring*
*Trade-off: Slower evolution but stable population*

### Broadcast Spawning (+3 alleles)

Some marine organisms release millions of eggs into the water:

- Coral can release 100+ million eggs in one spawning event
- Oysters release ~100 million eggs per year
- Most die, but survivors carry new mutations

This extreme r-strategy gives maximum allele income but is extremely vulnerable to environmental changes.

### Parental Care (-1 alleles, protected)

Parental care reduces the number of offspring but dramatically increases survival:

- Crocodiles guard nests and carry hatchlings
- Birds incubate eggs and feed chicks
- Mammals nurse young with milk

In the game, having Parental Care protects your markers from some population losses.

## 7. Organism Profiles

### The Crocodile Strategy

Crocodilians are "living fossils" - their body plan has been virtually unchanged for 200+ million years. Why?

**Optimal Design:**
- Semi-aquatic lifestyle provides multiple food sources
- Ambush predation is energy-efficient
- Burrowing ability provides extinction resistance
- Low metabolism means low food requirements

**Game Strategy:**
- Acquire Archosaur traits early
- Focus on population, not complexity
- Survive every extinction with [Burrowing] + [Aquatic]
- Win through raw population despite low complexity

### The Bird Strategy

Birds are the only surviving dinosaurs. Their success required:

**Trait Chain:**
1. Archosaur Posture (Era 5)
2. Hollow Bones (Era 6)
3. Feathers (Era 7)
4. Flight (Era 7)
5. Endothermy (Era 5) - soft prereq for flight efficiency

**Risk:** Long trait chain means high allele investment before payoff

**Reward:** 
- Flight allows movement to any tile
- [Avian] tag was SAFE during K-Pg
- High complexity score

### The Mammal Strategy

Mammals rose to dominance only after the K-Pg extinction removed dinosaur competition:

**Trait Chain:**
1. Synapsid Skull (Era 4)
2. Endothermy (Era 5)
3. Fur (Era 5)
4. Mammary Glands (Era 6)
5. Live Birth (Era 6)
6. Placenta (Era 8)

**Key Advantage:** [Small] + [Nocturnal] + [Burrowing] made early mammals extinction-resistant
