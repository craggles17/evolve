I am trying to build a hexagon tile flipping evolution game where you lay traits from a hand, deck builder, each trait will have evolutionary cost and pressure made from real equations, the traits can only appear at the correct gelogical era will will be the turn count, players can go around as many times as they like for each era, 



the tile flipping, will have a refernce on the back to the next tile and era locked qualities such as trees and flowers coral algae, the tile flipping should very rarely remove qualities but change them 



I think each tile should have something like a randomised chain to find the new tiles, and it will say the tile is era locked for flipping? each era some tiles should flip, based on a dice roll, maybe tiles will have a dice mark on them and an era lock mark to signify this



there will also be event cards per era, some good some bad, ideally based on the era we're going into include very scary marked extinction events. This will include ice ages and meteories, it will note locations and traits that can survive. 



the traits should be completely accurate and informative, the winner will have the largest population multiplied by their genetic complexity.



the tech tree will be the phylogenetic tree and fully accurate, write up an artefact plan for how we can design this to be balanced and scientifically accurate 



I also want a lookup for the nearest orrganism to what traits the player currently has, this is just for fun 



examples, bees can only evolve pollination near a flowers biome, but they cant migrate so its risky 



fish can evolve wings but if they dont evolve legs and lungs they'll never become birds so it becomes risky, 



crocodiles could be waiting to build genetic currency (alleles?) to add a better trait but it never comes and thats ok they just have low complexity but do survive
